# BasiliskVisualization
These codes can be used to do on the fly (almost) visualisation during Basilisk C simulations (http://basilisk.fr/)

vView2D_v0.py: This function is vView2D_v0(file, field)\n
               It takes plots a pcolormesh for the given field!\n
vView2D_v1.py: This function is vView2D_v1(file, Tracer, Auxiallaryfield, bool vector).\n
               file is compulsory. Default Auxiallaryfield is tracer f\n
               bool vector decides between vector field or streamplot\n
